In this 6.5 hours long Javascript Bootcamp, I will train you with the most important javascript concepts so that you can start building websites and prepare for your upcoming front-end interviews.

I will try to explain things in a simple but effective way to make you understand and remember these concepts.

The video has been tagged with chapters ( timestamps ) if you want to jump to different sections.
