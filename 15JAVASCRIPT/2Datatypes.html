    There are 7 data types available in JavaScript. You need to remember that JavaScript is loosely
    typed(or dynamic language), so any value can be assigned to variables in JavaScript. According to latest ECMAScript
    standard there are 6 primitive data types and 1 object - 
    ● Number - represents integer and floating values
    ● String - represents textual data
    ● Boolean - logical entity with values as 'true' and 'false' 
    ● Undefined - represents variable whose value is not
    yet assigned
    ● Null - represents intentional absence of value
    ● Symbol - represents unique value
    ● Object - represents key value pair
    
    All of them except Object have immutable values, i.e. the values which cannot be changed. Some important information
    about the data types have been described below - 
    
    ● Number represents variables whose value is either an integer or float. It can have numbers in range between -(253-1) and (253). 
    Other than integer and float numbers, it has three symbolic values: +Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN.It uses 2 constants - Number.MAX_VALUE and
    Number.MIN_VALUE. Both of these constants lie between +Infinity and -Infinity. Eg., 10, -25.2, 8.321. ● String represents textual data. String contains elements that can
    be accessed using the index.
    
    The first element has index 0. Eg., "hello", "1234", "12here". You can access each
    element of string like - str="HelloWorld", then str[1] will output 'e' on the console.
