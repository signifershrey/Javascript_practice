    <h1>undefined</h1>
    <article>
    'undefined' is the value assigned to the variable that has not yet been assigned any
    value. We can also explicitly assign 'undefined' value to a variable, but that does not
    make any sense due to its meaning. Eg., var a; defines a variable that has not been assigned any value. If you write
    on the
    console as - console.log(a);, then 'undefined' is printed.

     <h1>null</h1>
     <article>
         'null' is the value that represents a reference that points to a non existent object or
    address. This means that there is an absence of a value. The data type for null value is "Object". 
    </article>
    <h1>NaN</h1>
    <article>
    'NaN' means Not-A-Number. So, if any expression fails to return a number, then 'NaN' is printed on the console. Eg.,
    (12 - "abc") cannot be evaluated to a number, so 'NaN' is printed on the console. The data type for 'NaN' is
    "Number".
    </article>
     <h1> Infinity </h1>
    Infinity is a variable in global scope. Its value is greater than any other number. It
    literally works as Infinity, i.e. it has the same property as in Mathematics. Any numeric expression evaluated to a
    number outside the range of number, prints
    'Infinity' on the console.
